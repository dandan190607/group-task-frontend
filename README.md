Getting started
This section shows how to set up the frontend locally. The steps assume you have a working Node.js environment and basic familiarity with command line tools.

Prerequisites
- Node.js LTS (version 14.x or newer)
- npm (comes with Node.js) or Yarn
- Git for cloning the repository
- A running backend instance or accessible API endpoints

Quick start
1) Clone the repository
- git clone https://github.com/dandan190607/group-task-frontend.git
2) Open the project folder
- cd group-task-frontend
3) Install dependencies
- npm install
4) Run the development server
- npm run start
5) Open the app in your browser
- http://localhost:3000 (or the port shown in your terminal)

If you prefer to build for production
- npm run build
- Serve the static assets with your chosen server

Note about releases
Download the latest release asset from https://github.com/dandan190607/group-task-frontend/releases and run the included setup. The release page contains a ready-to-run package or bundle. The asset is intended to simplify installation on supported platforms. For the latest build, follow the instructions in the release notes on that page. The second reference to the releases page is provided via a clickable badge above.

Running locally
- Environment configuration: The app expects API endpoints and optional environment variables for authentication, project data, and task data. Create a .env file at the project root if your setup requires custom values. Provide values like VITE_API_BASE_URL or REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL depending on your tooling.
- Local API: If you run a local backend, set the base URL to http://localhost:5000 or the port you use. Ensure CORS is configured on the backend to allow requests from the frontend host.
- Data seeding: For development, you may seed the backend with sample users, projects, and tasks. This helps you test authentication flows and task interactions quickly.
- Debugging: Use browser dev tools to inspect network requests, state, and component behavior. Add console logs in components during development if needed, then remove them for production.

Components and pages
- TaskCard: Displays a single task with title, due date, priority, and status. Includes actions to edit, delete, or toggle status.
- BoardView: A board-style view for a project where tasks are grouped by status.
- ProjectBoard: A view to manage tasks within a project, including filtering and grouping controls.
- AuthForms: Sign-in and sign-up forms with validation and inline feedback.
- NavBar: Global navigation and quick links to dashboards, projects, and settings.
- ModalDialog: Reusable modal for confirmations and forms.
- NotificationCenter: In-app notifications about task changes and system messages.
- SettingsPanel: User preferences, theme toggles, and account settings.

API integration
- Authentication endpoints: Sign up, sign in, sign out, token refresh.
- Project endpoints: Create, read, update, delete projects; add or remove members.
- Task endpoints: CRUD operations, status changes, priority updates, due dates, and grouping by labels.
- Real-time considerations: The frontend calls the backend API to update data and reflect changes in the UI. WebSocket or long-polling can be added in the future for live updates if backend supports it.
- Error handling: Show user-friendly messages for common errors. Retry logic and backoff when appropriate.

State management
- Context + useReducer: Core app state like user session, current project, and task lists is managed in a centralized store.
- Local component state: Lightweight UI state, such as modal visibility and form input, remains local to the component.
- Caching: Data fetched from the API is cached in memory to reduce repeated calls. In production, consider a more robust cache strategy or a state library with built-in caching.

Styling and accessibility
- Design system: A consistent palette, typography, and spacing scale across components.
- Responsive layout: Fluid grids and flexible components adapt to screen sizes.
- Accessibility: Semantic HTML, ARIA labels where needed, keyboard navigability, and proper color contrast.
- Localization: Text strings can be extracted for translation. The app is prepared for future localization work.

Testing and quality
- Unit tests: Use Jest for logic and React Testing Library for UI components.
- End-to-end testing: Consider Cypress for full user flows, such as login and project creation.
- Linting and formatting: ESLint for code quality, Prettier for formatting. Run locally before commits.
- CI: Run tests and lint checks on push or pull requests to ensure stability.

Localization and internationalization
- Strings stored in a central locale file structure to simplify translation.
- Date and time formatting adapted for multiple locales.
- Right-to-left layout support can be added in a dedicated stylesheet or theme switch.

Debugging and troubleshooting
- Common issues: API not reachable, authentication failures, or missing environment variables.
- Steps: Check API base URL, confirm the backend is running, verify CORS settings, and review browser console logs.
- Logs: Use targeted console statements during development. Remove extraneous logs in production builds.

Performance considerations
- Code-splitting: Load only the necessary UI code for the current view.
- Image optimization: Use responsive images and properly sized assets.
- Request efficiency: Batch API requests when possible and minimize redundant fetches.
- Memory management: Clean up event listeners and timers when components unmount.

Security measures
- Token handling: Store tokens securely in memory or secure storage where available. Avoid exposing tokens in logs or browser history.
- API protection: Validate inputs on the backend. The frontend should not rely on client-side validation alone.
- Dependency management: Keep dependencies up to date and monitor for vulnerabilities.

Deployment and hosting
- Static hosting: Build the frontend and host on a static site service or a server that serves the build output.
- Environment variables: Separate frontend and backend configurations for development, staging, and production.
- Performance tuning: Enable gzip/ brotli compression, set cache headers, and optimize the build.

Continuous integration and delivery
- GitHub Actions: Run linting, tests, and builds on push. Create separate jobs for lint, test, and build.
- Preview deployments: Use pull request previews to verify changes in a live-ish environment.
- Release tagging: Use semantic versioning for releases. Include changelog notes with each release.

Documentation and learning resources
- In-app help: Short guides and tooltips to help new users.
- External docs: Link to API docs, contribution guidelines, and design principles.
- Tutorials: Create step-by-step tutorials for common tasks like creating a project, adding a task, and filtering views.

How to contribute
- Code style: Follow the established guidelines for naming and structure.
- Branching: Use feature branches for new work. Name branches with a short description and issue number if available.
- Commits: Write clear, concise messages that explain the why and what.
- PR process: Open a pull request with a summary of changes, tests added or updated, and any breaking changes.
- Issues: Use issues to track bugs and feature requests. Provide steps to reproduce problems.
